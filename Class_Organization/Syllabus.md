## Instructor Information
**Instructor:** Dr. Matthew Bardoe  
**Room:** C126  
**Email:** mbardoe@wellington.org

## Course Overview

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{0.64\textwidth}
This course introduces students to the fundamentals of electronics, programming,
and computational design through hands-on experimentation with the Raspberry Pi
Pico W microcontroller and MicroPython. Students will learn to write and test
code that interacts with real-world sensors, actuators, and circuits, and will
use Git and GitHub to document their work. They will apply the engineering
design process to prototype, test, and refine systems that combine hardware and
software.

## By the End of the Course, Students Will:
- Understand fundamental electrical concepts including **voltage, current, and resistance**.  
- Write and debug programs in **MicroPython** using **Thonny**.  
- Apply **loops, conditionals, and functions** to control circuits and devices.  
- Use **Git and GitHub** to document and manage code versions.  
- Design and build circuits using components such as LEDs, buttons, servos, and sensors.  
- Apply the **engineering design process** to prototype and refine working systems.

---

## Materials & Resources
- Raspberry Pi Pico W (provided)  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, LEDs, and other electronic components  
- Laptop with **Thonny** installed and GitHub account created  
- Access to the Maker Space for fabrication as needed  
- Course materials provided digitally via Veracross or GitHub Classroom

## Grading and Assessments

Grades will be based on:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| Labs and Checkpoints | 25% | Small in-class builds and experiments |
| Design Projects | 40% | Includes mini-project and final capstone |
| Coding Quizzes | 20% | Short in-class quizzes requiring students to write and explain code without assistance |
| Participation and Collaboration | 15% | Engagement, teamwork, and use of GitHub for documentation |

### Coding Quizzes
Throughout the term, students will take several short **coding quizzes** to demonstrate mastery of programming skills.  
During these quizzes, students will write code independently (without AI tools) to solve a defined problem using MicroPython.  
Quizzes will ensure each student can confidently produce and explain code related to course content.

---

## Course Expectations
- **Be Safe:** Follow all Maker Space and electronics safety procedures.  
- **Be Respectful:** Support your peers, handle tools and components responsibly.  
- **Be Curious:** Experiment, test, and iterate to find creative solutions.  
- **Be Responsible:** Keep up with your commits, deadlines, and documentation.  

---

## Late Work & Academic Integrity
- Late work will be accepted within reason, but repeated lateness will affect grades.  
- All code and design work must be your own. Collaboration must be cited in reflections.  
- Submitting AI-generated code you do not understand violates the course AI policy.  

---

## AI Tools Policy
AI tools such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot may be used **for learning and debugging** but not for completing graded work.  
Students must document any AI assistance in their project README files.  
All code submitted for quizzes and projects must be fully understood and explainable by the student.
