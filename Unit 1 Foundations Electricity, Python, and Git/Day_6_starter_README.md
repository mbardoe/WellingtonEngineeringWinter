# Multi-Input, Multi-Output Circuit Project

## Overview

This project is part of Engineering: Electronics and Computer Programming.

The goal is to design and build a small embedded system that uses:
- At least **two input devices**, and
- At least **three output devices**,

and to write a MicroPython program that reads the inputs and produces at least **three distinct output behaviors** using the outputs.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Input Devices

1. Input #1:  
   - Type:  
   - Pico pin:  
   - What it controls:  

2. Input #2:  
   - Type:  
   - Pico pin:  
   - What it controls:  

(Add more if you choose additional inputs.)

### Output Devices

1. Output #1:  
   - Type:  
   - Pico pin:  
   - Behavior:  

2. Output #2:  
   - Type:  
   - Pico pin:  
   - Behavior:  

3. Output #3:  
   - Type:  
   - Pico pin:  
   - Behavior:  

(Add more if you choose additional outputs.)

## Initial Plan

Describe what you intended to build before you started wiring and coding.

- What is your system supposed to do?  
- How should the inputs affect the outputs?  
- What are the three distinct output behaviors you planned?  

---

## Circuit Design

Describe or sketch your circuit here. You may include a diagram as an image or link.

- How are power and ground distributed?  
- Which pins are used for each input and output?  
- Any special components (resistors, transistors, etc.)?  

### Pin Mapping Table

| Device        | Type (Input/Output) | Pico Pin | Notes              |
|---------------|---------------------|----------|--------------------|
|               |                     |          |                    |
|               |                     |          |                    |
|               |                     |          |                    |

## How to Run the Code

1. Flash MicroPython to the Pico (if needed).  
2. Copy `main.py` onto the Pico.  
3. Connect using Thonny and open the REPL.  
4. The program will start running when the Pico is reset or powered.

## Challenges and Debugging

Describe the main challenges you encountered while working on this project.

- Hardware issues (wiring mistakes, loose connections, wrong pin choices, power problems)  
- Software issues (bugs, logic errors, timing problems)  
- How you found and fixed each problem  

Be as specific as possible.

---

## Final Design vs. Initial Plan

Explain how your final project differs from your initial plan.

- Did you change any devices (inputs or outputs)?  
- Did any behaviors change or get simplified?  
- Did you add any new features?  

---

## Possible Improvements

If you had more time, what would you improve or add?

- Additional behaviors or modes  
- Better physical layout  
- More robust error handling in code

## AI Use Statement (If Applicable)

If you used AI tools (such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot), briefly describe how:

- What did you ask the AI to help with?  
- How did you change or adapt any code or ideas you got from AI?
