# 1. Primer on Electricity

## Voltage (V)
Electrical “pressure” pushing charges through a circuit.  
Water analogy: height of a water tank.

## Current (I)
Flow rate of electric charge.  
Water analogy: the amount of water flowing through a pipe each second.

## Resistance (R)
Opposition to current flow.  
Water analogy: a narrow or restricted pipe.

## Ohm’s Law
V = I * R

# 2. Circuits and the Water Analogy

## Circuit
A complete loop allowing current to flow.

### Battery / Power Source
Provides voltage (pressure).

### Resistor
Limits current.

### Diode
Allows current to flow in only one direction.

### Capacitor
Stores and releases charge.

### Switch
Opens or closes the circuit.

# 3. Key Vocabulary

## Pin
Connection point on a microcontroller (input, output, or power).

## Ground (GND)
The reference point for all voltages.

## Resistor
Limits current.

## LED
A diode that lights when current flows in the correct direction.

## Potentiometer
A variable resistor acting as a voltage divider.

## Analog
A smooth, continuously varying signal.

## Digital
A signal with only two states: HIGH or LOW.

## ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
Reads analog voltage as a digital value (0–65535).

## PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
Rapid ON/OFF switching to simulate analog output (brightness, motor speed).

## Pull-Up Resistor
Holds an input HIGH by default.

## Pull-Down Resistor
Holds an input LOW by default.

## Python Library
A module of reusable Python code.

## Firmware
Low-level software stored on hardware.
