# Day 7 Lesson Plan  
**Topics:** Quiz Announcement, Review Work Time, Project Work Time  
**Homework:** Complete the Review Quiz

---

## Lesson Overview

Students will be informed of the upcoming quiz on PWM, ADC, digital inputs/outputs, and Pico 2W pinout basics. The lesson focuses on structured review time followed by project work time. Students may ask clarifying questions, work through the review sheet individually or collaboratively, and meet with the instructor as needed. The period concludes with project continuation.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1. Identify topics and expectations for the upcoming quiz.  
2. Review PWM, ADC, digital input/output, and pinout concepts using the provided review sheet.  
3. Ask targeted questions to clarify misunderstandings.  
4. Continue development of their in-progress microcontroller projects.  
5. Prepare to complete the review quiz at home.

## Materials Needed

- Review Sheet and Practice Quiz (printed or digital)  
- Student notebooks or engineering journals  
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W boards and project materials  
- Whiteboard and markers  
- Student laptops with MicroPython environment  

---

## Schedule (60 minutes)

### 1. Opening (5 minutes)

- Announce that the quiz will take place on **Day 8**.  
- Briefly outline the quiz topics:  
  - Digital Inputs and Outputs  
  - PWM and duty cycle  
  - ADC concepts  
  - Pull-up and pull-down resistors  
  - Basic Pico 2W pinout  
- Tell students that today's focus is review and project continuation.

---

### 2. Review Sheet Introduction (5 minutes)

- Distribute (or display) the review sheet.  
- Highlight the structure: content review, multiple-choice items, short answer, and code understanding.  
- Explain that the homework is to complete the **Practice Quiz** section.  
- Encourage students to ask questions during the work period.

---

### 3. Guided Review Time (15 minutes)

- Students work through the review sheet.  
- Teacher circulates to answer questions.  
- Clarify any repeated misunderstandings (e.g., floating inputs, duty cycle meaning, ADC conversion ranges).  
- Provide small whiteboard explanations for students who need targeted help.

---

### 4. Project Work Time (30 minutes)

Students transition to continuing their individual or pair microcontroller projects.

During this time:

- Encourage students to integrate what they now understand about inputs/outputs, ADC, or PWM into their projects if relevant.  
- Hold short check-ins with project groups to assess progress.  
- Ensure students document what they worked on in their engineering journals.

Teacher circulation focus:

- Debug wiring or code issues.  
- Suggest enhancements tied to recent lessons.  
- Keep teams on task and help set a short-term goal for the next class.

---

## Closing (5 minutes)

- Remind students that **the homework is to complete the Practice Quiz** in the review sheet.  
- Tell students that the quiz next class will be brief and focused on fundamentals.  
- Encourage them to bring any remaining questions to the start of next class.

---

## Homework

- **Complete the Review Quiz (Practice Quiz section).**  
- Bring the completed review sheet to Day 8 for a quick warm-up before the quiz.
